  <p>Where The Side Walk Ends</p> 
  <p>There is a place where the sidewalk ends
And before the street begins,
And there the grass grows <br/> soft and white,
And there the sun burns <br/> crimson bright,
And there the moon-bird rests from his flight
To cool in the <br/> peppermint wind.</p> 
  <p>Let us leave this place where the smoke blows black
And the dark street winds and bends.
Past the pits where the asphalt <br/> flowers grow
We shall <br/> walk <br/> with <br/> a<br/>  walk <br/> that is measured and slow,
And watch where the chalk-white arrows go
To the place where the sidewalk ends.</p>
  <p>Yes we'll walk with a walk that is measured and slow,
And we'll go where the chalk-white arrows go,
For the children, <br/> they mark, <br/> and the children, they know
The place where the sidewalk ends.</p>
