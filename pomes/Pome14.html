  <h2 class= centered>Where The Side Walk Ends</h2> 
  <h3 class= regular>By Shel Silverstein</h3>
  <div class= "float1">
      <h4>There is a place where the sidewalk ends
And before the street begins,
And there the grass grows soft and white,
And there the sun burns crimson bright,
And there the moon-bird rests from his flight
          To cool in the peppermint wind.</h4></div> 
 
  <div class= "float2">
      <h5>Let us leave this place where the smoke blows black
And the dark street winds and bends.
Past the pits where the asphalt flowers grow
We shall walk with a walk that is measured and slow,
And watch where the chalk-white arrows go
          To the place where the sidewalk ends.</h5></div>
 
  <div class= "float3">
    <h6>Yes we'll walk with a walk that is measured and slow,
And we'll go where the chalk-white arrows go,
For the children, they mark, and the children, they know
The place where the sidewalk ends.</h6></div>
