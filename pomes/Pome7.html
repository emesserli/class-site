  <p>Where The Side Walk Ends</p> 
  <p>There is a place  where the sidewalk ends
And before the street begins,</p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  <p>And there the grass grows soft and white,
And there the sun burns crimson bright,
And there the moon-bird rests from his flight
To cool in the peppermint wind.</p> 
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  <p>Let us leave this place where the smoke blows black
And the dark street winds and bends.</p>
  <p>Past the pits where the asphalt flowers grow
We shall walk  with a walk  that is measured and slow,
And watch where the chalk-white arrows go
To the place where the sidewalk ends.</p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  <p>Yes we'll walk with a walk that is measured and slow,
And we'll go where the chalk-white arrows go,
For the children, they mark,and the children, they know
The place where the sidewalk ends.</p>
