    <h4>Where The Side Walk Ends</h4> 
    <h4 class= regular>By Shel Silverstein</h4>
    
    <div id="div1"linear> There is a place where the sidewalk ends 
And before the street begins,
And there the grass grows soft and white,
And there the sun burns crimson bright,
And there the moon-bird rests from his flight
    To cool in the peppermintwind.</div>
<br/> 
<br/> 
<br/> 
<br/> 
<br/> 
  
    <div id="div2"linear> Let us leave this place where the smoke blows black
And the dark street winds and bends.
Past the pits where the asphalt flowers grow
We shall walk with a walk that is measured and slow,
And watch where the chalk-white arrows go
        To the place where the sidewalk ends.</div>
<br/> 
<br/> 
<br/> 
<br/> 
<br/> 
 
    <div id="div3"linear> Yes we'll walk with a walk that is measured and slow,
And we'll go where the chalk-white arrows go,
For the children, they mark, and the children, they know
        The place where the sidewalk ends.</div>
