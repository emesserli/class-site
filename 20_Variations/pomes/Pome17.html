    <h2>Where The Side Walk Ends</h2> 
    <h2>By Shel Silverstein </h2>
  
    <h4> There is a <span class=kiss>place</span> where the sidewalk ends
And before the street begins,
And there the grass grows soft and white,
And there the sun burns crimson bright,
And there the moon-bird rests from his flight
    To cool in the peppermintwind.</h4>
    <span class=kiss><div id="square2"></div></span>
<br/> 
<br/> 
<br/> 
<br/> 
<br/> 
  
    <h4> Let us leave this place where the smoke blows black
And the dark street winds and bends.
Past the pits where the asphalt flowers grow
We shall walk with a walk that is measured and slow,
And watch where the chalk-white arrows go
To the place where the sidewalk ends.</h4>
    
    <span class=kiss><div id="square1"></div></span> 
<br/> 
<br/> 
<br/> 
<br/> 
<br/> 
 
    <h4> Yes we'll walk with a walk that is measured and slow,
And we'll go where the chalk-white arrows go,
For the children, they mark, and the children, they know
        The place where the sidewalk ends.</h4>
