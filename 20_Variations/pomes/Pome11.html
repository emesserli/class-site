  <p>Where The Side Walk Ends</p> 
  <p>By Shel Silverstein</p>
 
  <p>There is a place  where the sidewalk ends
And before the street begins,</p>
    
  <div class="float1"><p>And there the grass grows soft and white,
And there the sun burns crimson bright,
And there the moon-bird rests from his flight 
      To cool in the peppermint wind.</p></div>  
    
  <div class="float2"><p>Let us leave this place where the smoke blows black
    And the dark street winds and bends.</p></div>
  
  <div class="float3"><p>Past the pits where the asphalt flowers grow
      We shall <span class="walk">walk</span> with a <span class="walk">walk</span> that is measured and slow, And watch where the chalk-white arrows go To the place where the sidewalk ends.</p></div>
    
 <p>Yes we'll <span class="walk">walk</span> with a <span class="walk">walk</span> that is measured and slow, And we'll go where the chalk-white arrows go, 
 For the children, they mark,and the children, they know
 The place where the sidewalk ends.</p>
